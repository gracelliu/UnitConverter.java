# Unit Converter Application
The Unit Converter Application is a Java program that provides a user-friendly interface to convert values between different units of time, length, and weight. The application is built using Java 8 and utilizes the Swing library for the graphical user interface.

</br> 

## Features
Convert time between seconds, minutes, hours, days, and years.
Convert length between meters, centimeters, kilometers, and feet.
Convert weight between kilograms, grams, and pounds.

</br>

## User Story
As a user who frequently deals with various units of time, length, and weight, I want a simple and efficient tool to perform conversions between different units. The Unit Converter Application should provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing me to quickly convert values without the need for manual calculations.

</br> 

## Design Patterns
The program follows the principles of Clean Architecture, with four distinct layers: Entities, Use Cases, Interface Adapters, and Framework & Drivers. It uses the Factory Method design pattern to create instances of converter classes based on user input, promoting modularity and extensibility.

## Version of Java and Testing Framework
Java version: Java 8
Testing Framework: JUnit

</br> 

## Code Smells and SOLID Compliance
The program aims to maintain code quality and adheres to SOLID principles. Design patterns like Factory Method promote a separation of concerns and modularity, reducing code smells and promoting maintainability. The classes are well-organized, and dependencies are managed effectively, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

</br> 

## Remaining Improvements
The codebase is kept clean, and no significant code smells or violations of SOLID or Clean Architecture principles were identified during the development. The use of design patterns and modularity allows for easy extension of the converter application to support additional unit conversions or UI enhancements.
